# The Physical Universe 
## An Introduction to Astronomy : *Frank H. Shu*


One of the most celebrated books to dive deep into astronomy :stars:, we members of Astronomy Club at IIT Kanpur read, discussed and analysed some of the interesting chapters, namely 14, 15 and 16 in this *2020 lockdown.*

Here you can find an easy-to-understand handbook containing
* *Chapter 14: **Clusters of Galaxies and the Expansion of the Universe***
* *Chapter 15: **Gravitation and Cosmology***
* *Chapter 16: **The Big Bang***
* *Mathematics : **Tensors*** 

We have covered each topic from the chapter, whilst maintaining simplicity in the beautiful Latex format.

Find the acknowledgements and bibliography(references) in the *pdf* itself.

So wear your nerdy hat :nerd_face: and enjoy our small effort as part of RAD Project 2020 @ AstroClubIITK.

Star the repo if it you liked it, or atleast if it inspired you in some way or the other.

**PS** : Do read the book, it is worth it. I have also [***uploaded soft copy***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19e1-4o3qLJfRL1Po4lCl4zrlZ9hb7wcC/view?usp=sharing) of the entire book :notebook_with_decorative_cover: so you don't have to scratch your heads on the Google (the links are messed up, believe me).
